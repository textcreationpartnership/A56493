         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb n="2" facs="tcp:97285:6"/>
                  <hi>Middleſex,</hi> beſides the High Conſtables of the Hundreds, they have Petty Conſtables and Headboroughs in the reſpective Pariſhes, and they are in number more or leſs, according to the greatneſs or ſmalneſs of the Pariſh; in <hi>Kent</hi> theſe Petty Officers of the Pariſhes are called Borſholders; but in <hi>Hampſhire,</hi> and all the Weſtern Parts, Tythingmen, and their Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions of Pariſhes, Tythings; in <hi>Suſſex</hi> the Hundreds are called Rapes; and in the North, Ridings and Wapentakes.</p>
               <p>There was antiently in <hi>England,</hi> a great Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer called the High Conſtable of <hi>England,</hi> and he kept an Office (which is ſuppoſed to come hither with <hi>William</hi> the Conqueror out of <hi>Normandy</hi>) or Court, called the Conſtables Court, or the Court of the High Conſtable, wherein he had Authority to hear and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine Contracts, touching Deeds of Arms out of the Realm, and to determine all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning War within the Realm; as Combats, Blazon, Armory, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but not to deal with Battel in Appeals, that belonging to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law of the Land.</p>
               <p>Amongſt the reſt of the <hi>Conquerors</hi> Laws, this is one, That if a <hi>French-man</hi> do Appeal an <hi>Engliſh-man</hi> of Perjury or Murder, the <hi>French-man</hi> may defend himſelf by <hi>Battail,</hi> Which in Engliſh was then called <hi>Earneſt,</hi> which Word we yet retain; and the Officer to ſee this performed, was the High Conſtable; but this Officer, Court and Practice, is long ſince diſſolved.</p>
               <p>The Etymology of this word <hi>Constable,</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from the old word <hi>Conning</hi> or <hi>Cyng,</hi> and <hi>Staple</hi> or <hi>Stable;</hi> the word <hi>Conning</hi>

or <hi>Cyng,</hi> ſignifies a King, and <hi>Stable,</hi> a Stay or Prop; which is as much as to ſay, the <hi>ſtay</hi> or <hi>Prop</hi> of the <hi>King;</hi> that great Officer the <hi>Conſtable</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> having that Title given by reaſon of the great Authority that he had, was a principal Prop or Stay unto the Kings Government; from whence is this Title and Office of this Lower Conſtableſhip de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived and continued (though with leſſer Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority unto this hour) and is a Branch of that Original.</p>
               <p>By the Statute of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> made in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the Firſt, theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables of Hundreds were appointed to keep Watching and Warding, for the better keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Peace, and prevention of Thieveries and Robberies, and apprehenſions of Felons and Rogues, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and that the High Conſtables in every Hundred and Franchiſe, ſhould take the view of Armor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THere are three kind of Ways; Firſt, A Foot-way, called <hi>Iter, quod eſt jus eundi, vel ambulandi hominis.</hi> Secondly, a Foot-way and an Horſe-way, called <hi>actus, ab agendo,</hi> and this vulgarly is called a Pack or Drift-way, and is both a Foot-way and Horſe-way. Thirdly, A Cart-way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> called <hi>Via</hi> or <hi>Aditus,</hi> (and containeth the other two, and a Cart-way alſo) for this is <hi>jus eundi, vehendi, &amp; vehiculum &amp;

               <p>It is called the Kings High-way, for that the King at all times hath therein Paſſage for Him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his People, and may puniſh all Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſances therein, though otherwiſe the Intereſt be in the Lord to bring his Action for dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging therein, or other like Treſpaſs there done, <hi>Dalt.
